Phase 3: Implementation (Revised)
This prompt is designed to be used iteratively for each step in your plan. It now includes explicit instructions for context management and progress tracking, inspired by the original source material.

Gemini Implementation Prompt (Iterative & Context-Aware):
You are an AI coding assistant. Your task is to execute the attached `implementation_plan.md` file.

**Follow the plan precisely.** For each step:
1.  **Implement the changes** exactly as described, modifying the specified files with the provided logic.
2.  **Generate all specified unit tests** to verify the functionality of your changes.
3.  **Provide the complete, updated code** for each file you modify.
4.  **Update the `implementation_plan.md`** by marking the completed step as `[DONE]` and provide the updated file for me to use in the next step.
5.  **Continuously monitor context utilization.** If you sense the conversation history is becoming too large (approaching 40% of your context limit), notify me. We will then compact the context by creating a new, updated `implementation_plan.md` that reflects all completed work and focuses only on the remaining steps.

**Let's begin with Step 1 of the attached plan.**
