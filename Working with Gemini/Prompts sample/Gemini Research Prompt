Phase 1: Research
This phase is about understanding the existing codebase and the user's requirements. Instead of a formal requirements.md file, you can simply state your requirements in plain English as part of the prompt.

Gemini Research Prompt:
You are an AI coding assistant. Your task is to analyze the provided codebase to understand how to implement a new feature.

**The user's requirement is:** [Clearly describe the new feature or change you want to make, e.g., "Implement a new authentication method using Google OAuth."]

**Your task is to:**
1.  **Analyze the current codebase** to identify all relevant files, functions, and classes related to the user's requirement.
2.  **Map the existing code structure** to the new feature, highlighting where the new code will need to be added or modified.
3.  **Identify any potential conflicts, gaps, or dependencies** that need to be addressed.
4.  **Summarize your findings in a `research_summary.md` file.** This summary should include:
    * A list of relevant files and their paths.
    * Key code snippets and line numbers that are relevant to the new feature.
    * A summary of any potential challenges or areas that require special attention.
    * Any questions you have for me before proceeding to the planning phase.

**Tone & Style:** Be concise, precise, and focus on providing actionable insights that will be used in the next phase.
