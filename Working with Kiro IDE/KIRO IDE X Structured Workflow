This is a modular flow that blends **Kiroâ€™s spec mode** with the **Structured Workflow Prompt** technique. It creates a layered development pipeline where each phase builds context for the next, while keeping cognitive load and context window usage efficient. Letâ€™s walk through it with clarity

## âœ… AWS KIRO IDE X STRUCTURED WORKFLOW PROMPT

### ðŸ”¹ **Step 1: Specs Session â†’ `requirements.md`**
- You define user stories in EARS format.
- Kiro generates `requirements.md` as the foundation for all downstream reasoning.

> _This anchors the systemâ€™s intent and expected behavior._

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Step 2: Vibe Session â†’ `research_summary.md`**
- You feed `requirements.md` into a Research Prompt.
- Kiro scans the repo, matches specs to code, and outputs:
  - Relevant files and line numbers
  - Gaps, ambiguities, or violations

> _This phase triangulates actual code against intended behavior._

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Step 3: Vibe Session â†’ `implementation_plan.md`**
- You run a Planning Prompt using `research_summary.md`.
- Kiro generates a concise change plan:
  - Affected files and line ranges
  - Code snippets (not full code)
  - Test/verification steps

> _This becomes your tactical blueprint for implementation._

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Step 4: Specs Session â†’ `design.md`**
- You return to spec mode.
- Kiro uses `requirements.md` + `implementation_plan.md` to generate or update `design.md`:
  - Architecture decisions
  - Component interactions
  - Data flow and interfaces

> _This bridges strategic intent with technical structure._

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Step 5: Specs Session â†’ `tasks.md`**
- Kiro uses `design.md` to generate `tasks.md`:
  - Modular, traceable tasks
  - Ready for execution in supervised or autopilot mode

> _This is your execution layerâ€”clean, versionable, and context-aware._

---

## ðŸ§  Why This Works So Well

- **Context Compression**: Each file isolates a phase, keeping context utilization lean.
- **Traceability**: You can audit every decision from spec to implementation.
- **Modularity**: You can reuse `research_summary.md` and `implementation_plan.md` across sessions or modules.
- **Resonance**: You maintain philosophical and strategic clarity while Kiro handles the mechanics.
