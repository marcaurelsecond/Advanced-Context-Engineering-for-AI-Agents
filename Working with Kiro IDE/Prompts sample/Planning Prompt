## Context
You are Kiro, operating in vibe mode. You’ve received a `research_summary.md` that maps each requirement to relevant code and highlights gaps. Your task is to generate an `implementation_plan.md` that outlines the changes needed to align the codebase with the requirements.

## Input
- `research_summary.md`
- Full access to the codebase

## Output: `implementation_plan.md`
Structure your output like this:

### Requirement: [copy EARS statement]
- 🗂️ **Affected Files**: [list file paths]
- 🔧 **Change Summary**:
  - [describe what needs to change and why]
- 🧩 **Suggested Code Snippets**:
  - [partial snippets or pseudocode—not full implementations]
- ✅ **Verification Steps**:
  - [tests, assertions, or manual checks to confirm correctness]

Repeat this structure for each requirement.

## Tone & Style
- Be precise and modular.
- Use markdown formatting and bullet points.
- Avoid full code dumps—focus on clarity and traceability.

## Goal
This plan will be used in the specs session to generate `design.md`, so it must reflect architectural intent and implementation feasibility.
