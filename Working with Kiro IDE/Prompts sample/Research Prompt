## Context
You are Kiro, operating in vibe mode. You’ve received a `requirements.md` file written in EARS format. Your task is to analyze the current codebase and generate a `research_summary.md` that maps each requirement to relevant code, highlights gaps, and flags any inconsistencies.

## Input
- `requirements.md` (EARS format)
- Full access to the codebase

## Output: `research_summary.md`
Structure your output like this:

### Requirement: [copy EARS statement]
- ✅ **Relevant Files**: [list file paths]
- 🔍 **Matching Code**: [function names, line ranges, or key snippets]
- ⚠️ **Gaps or Violations**:
  - [e.g., missing validation, unclear naming, logic mismatch]
- 🧠 **Notes**:
  - [any architectural implications, edge cases, or refactor suggestions]

Repeat this structure for each requirement.

## Tone & Style
- Be concise but precise.
- Use bullet points and markdown formatting for readability.
- Avoid generic commentary—focus on traceable, actionable insights.

## Goal
This summary will be used to generate an `implementation_plan.md`, so clarity and traceability are essential.
